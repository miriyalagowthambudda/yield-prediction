A lot of crop is destroyed every year due to lack of knowledge of weather
patterns such as temperature, rainfall, etc. which play a huge role in
deciding the crop yield. This project not only helps in predicting these
parameters for throughout the year , but also assists in predicting the yield
of various crops in various seasons based on past trends. Hence it allows
the farmers to decide the best crop to grow to suffer minimum losses.

The reason for this decline in the agriculture sector is due to the fact that
farmers are not empowered and due to lack of application of IT in the
farming sector. Farmers have less knowledge about the crops they grow.


We tend to overcome this obstacle by applying machine learning
techniques to predict the crop yield and name by considering various
factors such as temperature, rainfall,
season and area.
