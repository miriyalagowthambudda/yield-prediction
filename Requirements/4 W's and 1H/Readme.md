why:

evaluation of a prediction model which may be used for the prediction of crop yield


what:

By analyzing all these issues and problems like weather, temperature and several factors we can propose a model which will improve the crop proction and contribute to the nations GDP.

who:

farmers will be the most benefetial from this by avoiding the risks factors of which crop should cultivate at what season considering the rainfall,temoerature and soil type.

where:

by using all the available data we can predict the crop yield of various crops and the best one will be selected at a suitable time using the machine learning models in india itsef.

how:

using machine learning algorithms we can predict the crop yield prediction which will be benefitial to all the farmers.
