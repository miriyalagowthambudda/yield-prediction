The history of Agriculture in India dates back to Indus Valley Civilization
Era and even before that in some parts of Southern India.India ranks
second worldwide in farm outputs. Agriculture and allied sectors like
forestry and fisheries accounted for 15.4% of the GDP (gross domestic
product) in 2016 with about 31% of the workforce in 2014. India ranks first
globally with highest net cropped area followed by US and China.The
economic contribution of agriculture to India's GDP is steadily declining with
the country's broad-based economic growth. Still, agriculture is
demographically the broadest economic sector and plays a significant role
in the overall socio-economic fabric of India.
