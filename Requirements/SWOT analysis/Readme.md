1 Strenghts

Yield prediction is a vital agricultural drawback. each farmer is curious about knowing, what proportion
yield he's concerning expect. within the past, yield prediction was performed by considering farmer's previous
expertise on a specific crop. the amount of knowledge is big in Indian agriculture. info once become
information is very helpful for several functions.

we can improve the GDP of the nation through agriculture.
we can reduce the loss to the farmers by recommending the suitable crop at suitable season base don the rainfall,temnperature and soil type and season.


2.weakness

the main drawback is that farmers are not associated with the IT services and they follow the old monk style of agriculture and faces the consequences later.
so we can associate farmers with the new IT  technologies and understand the need to impeove the production.
constant observation is needed inorder to produce a great production.


3.opportunities

By using the mcahine learning algorithms we can accurateley predict the most suitable crop depending upon the soil type,rainfall and temperature , which inturn increases the production and GDP of the nation.
we could even use the artificial intelligence which will mimic the actions of a human being which produces much better results.
by using the day to day technologies we can reduces the lossess of farmers and we can make them having better production.


4.threats

if we couldnt follow the new technologies farmers will eventually face the lossess and which effects the nations gdp.
most of the fellow companies have started using the machine learning algorithms and applying them on various agricultural fields ,so its better if are step ahead of them.
