This  work focuses  in investigating  the prediction  of Crop yield  and the  cost estimation.  The  proposed methodology uses the tree algorithm in order to predict the results efficiently and proves to best suitable for the research work. The data collected, is analysed and worked to predict the yield and the cost of the crops at any given time. 
The research work majorly involves the following implementation modules.
1. Data Acquisition
2. Data Exploration 
3. Machine learning prediction 
4. Result analysis
